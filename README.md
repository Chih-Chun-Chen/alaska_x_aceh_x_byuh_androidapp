Anchorage Coalition to End Homelessness is a company that has the vision to make homelessness rare, brief, and one-time. They work towards this vision by connecting people experiencing homelessness to state and local resources. This project aims to utilize the data about top communication needs for people experiencing homelessness in Anchorage, Alaska, and create an app for them.
Our objective for this project is to identify and collect data about the primary needs of those experiencing homelessness and organize that information in an app.
BYU-Hawaii Outreach team interviewed over 30 clients and collected data on their priorities and needs. Furthermore, the Outreach team did research on the possible solutions that other areas do to solve their homelessness issue.  Based on these research results, the BYU-Hawaii App team put the top primary needs of homeless people in Alaska in an app. This app is accessible through different devices and will be reliable, and easy to use. This app provides easy communication between the government and homeless people. It also provides information regarding the location of meals, transportation, health care, and shelter.
